Then access the Colab HOGFeatureClassification.ipynb.
There, you can load our pre-processed HOG data and run our various models. Specifically, under 'Best Model' you can load the pre-trained SoftMax + HOG model and evaluate its accuracy on our test data. You can also run the demo we presented in class.
